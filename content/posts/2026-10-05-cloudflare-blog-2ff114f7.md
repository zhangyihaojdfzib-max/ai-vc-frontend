We celebrated our 16th birthday last week by sharing how weâre building a better Internet for todayâs world. As Matthew and Michelle reflected inthis yearâs Foundersâ Letter, this year saw some of the most consequential changes in the history of the Internet.

For the first time, automated traffic surpassed human activity. AI is empowering people to build like never before, leading the Internet to grow massively in scale and unlocking more ambition and creativity. As we witnessed the influence that agent-driven recommendations have on consumer choices, we identified the need for a new approach that creates space for new businesses to succeed.

Each day of Birthday Week explored a different way we are helping to build the future of the Internet. We began on Monday by strengthening our commitment to open source. Tuesday focused on application security and the post-quantum transition. On Wednesday, we explored new economic models for the agentic Internet. Thursday, we expanded the Developer Platform with new tools for data analysis, storage, AI, and agent development. Finally, we closed out the week by launching features that make Cloudflare faster, easier to operate, and more accessible to everyone. As a special Birthday Week follow-up, weshared an updateÂ on our intern program,one year after announcing our goal to hire 1,111 interns. Interns directly contributed to many of the projects launched this week, including EmDash, post-quantum visibility, CryptoLabe, and Protected Quick Tunnels.

We shipped 46 announcements this week. In case you missed any, hereâs the full list of everything we announced during Birthday Week 2026.

### Monday, September 28 - Commitment to open source

With the announcement of our new CLI, which we released alongside the pipeline we use to generate it and our SDKs and docs, we shared how weâre building to support agents and developers as they use Cloudflare â and supporting the projects that you rely on, too.
