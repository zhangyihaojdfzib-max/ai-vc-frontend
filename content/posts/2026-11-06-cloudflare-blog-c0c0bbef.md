The highest prioritiesÂ for the transition to post-quantum cryptography are the basic building blocks of authenticated key-agreement protocols such as TLS. Without these building blocks in place, secure communication on the Internet will not be possible once cryptographically relevant quantum computers come online. However, today we rely on quantum-vulnerable cryptography for much more than TLS.

Privacy PassÂ is a protocol used by site operators like Cloudflare to help protect applications from abuse. One way we do this is by rate limiting individual clients so that no one client consumes too many of the site's resources. Normally this involves some combination of friction or loss of privacy for users: CAPTCHAs or other challenges to moderate traffic, along with accounts and fingerprinting to identify traffic.Privacy Pass was designed to avoid this tradeoff between friction and privacy. The basic idea is that a client gets issued a number oftokens, which they can redeem in exchange for access to the site. Crucially, each token isÂ unlinkableÂto the client it was issued to, ensuring the client can use the site as they always had without sacrificing privacy.

With 10 years of deployment experience under our belts â using Privacy Pass for applications such as privacy proxies (like iCloud Private Relay) and relays (like Privacy Gateway) â we, along withothers, are collaborating to bring the next generation of this technology to the web. One of our goals is to develop more sophisticated tools for managing agentic traffic that would otherwise consume too many resources and degrade performance for human visitors. Another goal is to foster a more open ecosystem byÂ making it easier for more types of clients to participate.Â Achieving these goals requires developing new capabilities beyond what Privacy Pass offers today.

Given the trajectory, in this post we look at the prospects for post-quantum. In fact, we're in better shape than one might think. Privacy Pass still relies on classical cryptography, like RSA and elliptic curves. This means that a quantum attacker will be able to forge tokens at will and use them to bypass whatever security mechanism the site operator wants to implement (such as rate limiting). On the other hand, Privacy Pass isunconditionallyprivate, meaning no attacker, quantum or not, can link the redemption of a token to its issuance. What's more, the new capabilities we're developing for this new generation of private authentication technology Â can and will be instantiatedÂ in a way that upholdsÂ the same guarantee: your interaction remains private even after Q-day.

This gives us a little breathing room, but we will need an alternative soon. This is an active area of research that has made significant strides in recentÂ years. Still, just as is the case with other aspects of the transition, the primary challenge is the sheer size of post-quantum alternatives: ML-DSA-44 signatures are a whopping 2,420 bytes, while ECDSA-P256 signatures are just 64 bytes. And there's not much hope for drop-in replacements any time soon. Just as for TLS,we'll have to settleÂ for primitives with higher cost andre-engineer our systems to bear this cost.

But what will those primitives be? In this post, we'll explore one potential future for post-quantum privacy on the web, made possible by a recent breakthrough in the design of blind signatures.

## WhatÂ we need to build: a brief look at MOLE

Let's start with an overview of this new technology, which is presently calledMOLEÂ ("Moderation Of unLinkable Endorsements"). We'll have much more to say about MOLE later on, but for now we'll highlight the details that are most relevant to cryptography.

One of the core components of Privacy Pass is ablind signatureÂ scheme, which allows a client to obtain a signature under an issuer's secret key without revealing to the issuer the message that it signed. The client can then reveal the message and blind signature later on without linking the signature to its issuance.

![image4.png](/images/posts/538d29e42d96.jpg)

One type of Privacy Pass token consists of the message and blindly issued signature. To verify the token, the verifier needs the issuer's public key, and so necessarily learns the identity of the issuer. Thus while these tokens protect the identity of the client, theydon'tprotect the identity of the issuer.

Of course, this is exactly what we want for some use cases. The identity of the issuer tells us something about what type of client is connecting to our edge, a signal we use to make decisions in some of our products and for some of our customers.Â For instance, a client might use a token issued by one of our customers to prove it is authorized to use the customer's VPN product.

However, for many use cases,Â this is more information than we actually need to make a decision to grant a client access to a resource. Normally we only care that the token was issued bysomeÂ entity we trust. In fact, MOLE takes this a step further: the token shouldhideÂ the identity of the issuer altogether so that wecan'tÂ treat tokens differently based on who issued them. This guarantees equal treatment regardless of the type of client, making it easier for more clients to participate.

![](/images/posts/47375fec49cd.jpg)

This issuer-hiding property is achieved through a new object called anendorsement.Â An endorsement is issued by ananchorÂ and redeemed by amoderator. Before redemption, the client and moderator agree on ananchor set, the public keys of the anchors trusted by the moderator. During redemption, the client proves it was issued an endorsement byone of the anchorsÂ in the anchor set without revealing which one. Upon acceptance, the moderator issues the client the MOLEcredentialÂ it will use to moderate the client's interaction with the site.

An endorsement can take many forms, but its key property is that it can be redeemed while hiding the identity of the anchor that issued it. There will also be many types of credentials, but because they're intended to be used by a particular moderator, they needn't be anchor-hiding or even publicly verifiable. This means that everything from blind signatures toanonymous credit tokensÂ oranonymous rate-limited credentialsÂ can be used to instantiate MOLE credentials.

Now that we have a sense of what we're building, let's look at our options for post quantum.

## A feastÂ of cryptography

When designing cryptographic protocols, adaptability and efficiency are often in tension. Sometimes we know exactly what we want to build and can tailor a construction for that purpose; but the more we tailor the protocol for that use case, the harder it becomes to adapt that construction to a different use case.

Adaptability is essential for a system like MOLE. We're not just building one kind of credential system, but many. And the types of credentials we need are likely to change over time, especially on the web where we must constantly adapt to new traffic patterns and attacker behavior. To keep up, we need a set of building blocksÂ that can be composed together into different protocols to meet different requirements.

Most of the post-quantum cryptographic schemes in wide use today come from larger families of constructions, but have been tuned for their particular application. ML-DSA is a good example here: the cryptographic framework from which this scheme was derived can be used to build a variety of things, but to make ML-DSA as compact as possible, its parameters have been carefully tailored to build an efficient and secure digital signature scheme. However, the same parameters would not necessarily be secure for other use cases.

We have come to view this as the central challenge for post-quantum anonymous credentials:to decouple parameter selection from protocol design. Classical credential systems take this for granted: for the most part, protocol designers don't need to think about the parameters of the elliptic curve they're using, allowing even non-experts in the design of elliptic curve cryptography to build useful things with it. Unfortunately, designing efficient post-quantum credentialsstill requires an enormous amount of expertise.

This situation seems to have changed, however. Earlier this year, we saw abreakthroughÂ that represents a potential sea change for anonymous credentials.

### VOLE-in-the-Head

The roots of this breakthrough go back several years. We'll pick up the story three years ago, with the VOLE-in-the-Head (VOLEitH)Â zero-knowledge proof system (Baum et al., Crypto 2023). A zero-knowledge proof system allows one to prove knowledge of a hiddenwitness,Â satisfying some public statement while keeping the witness private. For example, a zero-knowledge proof can be used to prove knowledge of an AES key KÂ for which Y=AES(K,X), where X,YÂ  are public. This proof can be transformed into a digital signature whose security reduces to the security ofÂ AES, with X,YÂ as the public key and KÂ as the secret key. This is exactly theFAESTÂ digital signature, a candidate inNIST's ongoing signature competition.

Compared to many contemporary proof systems, VOLEitHÂ is relatively simple to understand and implement securely. VOLE stands for "Vector Oblivious Linear Evaluation" and is an interactive technique that gives two parties correlated random values. These correlations act like authentication tags, allowing the verifier to check that a computation on the hidden witness was performed correctly. In VOLEitH, the prover prepares locally what the two parties would normally generate together â hence âin the headâ â then commits to those values and uses the Fiat-Shamir transformation (a widely used tool in cryptography) to select the parts the verifier checks. This step turns the interactive VOLE process into a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof.

Apart from its simplicity, VOLEitH is a fairly unremarkable proof system. It's not succinct in the way many other proof systems are: its proofs are asymptotically linear in the size of the witness and the arithmetic complexity of the statement being proved. However, VOLEitH isconcretelyÂ very efficient for a particular type of statement, namely one that can be expressed as a set of equations over small binary fields.

One example is the relation Y=AES(K,X) we just discussed. We don't normally think of AES as a set of equations, but many of its computations are designed around arithmetic in GF(28), a field whose elements are single bytes. FAEST proofs for this statement are only about 4KB (NIST Round 3, 128s).

Another example is theKuMQuatsignature scheme, in which the signer proves an instance of the Multivariate Quadratic (MQ)problem. Here we're given a system of random, quadratic equations of multiple variables over a small field, like GF(28). Mathematically, this MQ map P looks something like P(s) = (sTA1s + b1s,â¦,sTAms + bms) where s and each biare length n vectors and each Aiis an n-by-n matrix. Given P,P(s) for random s, the MQ problem is to find s. We call it quadratic because we multiply the elements of s by itself.

The MQ problem is believed to be hard to solve even for a quantum computer. But becausePÂ is made up of quadratic equations, proving knowledge of a solution with VOLEitHÂ is fairly cheap, yielding KuMQuat signatures as small as 2.6KB.

When compared to other post-quantum signatures like ML-DSA or FN-DSA, these numbers don't look especially impressive. But how VOLEitH compares to other schemesin a particular categoryÂ of constructions is beside the point. For MOLE, we'll need to strike a balance between performance and the ability to build many types of credential systems. To that end, we need one more ingredient.

### Multivariate signatures

Another way to build signatures from MQ maps involves embedding some additional mathematical structure into the map. In theUnbalanced Oil and Vinegar (UOV)Â signature scheme, the public key is an MQ map P, and a signature is a vector sÂ satisfying P(s) = t, where tÂ is obtained by hashing and salting the message to be signed.

The secret key for this signature scheme is atrapdoorÂ for PÂ with which the signer can derive solutions to the MQ equations. The trapdoorÂ reveals to the signer a hidden partitioning of the variables of each quadratic equation into âoilâ and âvinegarâ variables. Oil variables are never multiplied by one another, so fixing the vinegar values turns the equations into a linear system that the signer can solve for the oil values. In the public key, oil and vinegar variables are mixed together in a way that hides this structure in the map.

UOV is also a candidate in NIST's ongoing signature standardization effort. It has one of the smallest signatures among the candidates, at just 135 bytes. The trade-off is that it has the largest public keys, at 46.6KB.MAYOÂ is another multivariate candidate withÂ much smaller public keys, at the cost of slightly larger signatures.

The key thing to take away here is that the arithmetic complexity of evaluating a UOV (or MAYO) signature is comparable to evaluating an MQ instance. Both are public quadratic maps over small binary fields, making them a good fit for VOLEitH. This brings us to the breakthrough.

### Blind signatures from VOLE-in-the-Head and UOV

Earlier this year, a blind signature called PoMFRITÂ was published (Baum et al., USENIX Security 2026) that achieved what at the time was a record for candidate post-quantum constructions: 6.7KB for the blind signature itself and just a few hundred bytes for issuance. PoMFRIT is based on VOLE-in-the-Head and the MAYO multivariate signature. We can easily drive the size of the signature down to 4.3KB by swapping MAYO out for UOV. (This figure uses NIST round 3 parameters for UOV (uov-Ip) and FAEST-EM-128s.) The trade-off is larger public keys, but this pays off in applications where a public key can be cached and used sufficiently often.

This is competitive withstate-of-the-art lattice-based constructions. But the really good news is that building blocks of PoMFRIT can easily be reconfigured into all of the credential systems we've considered for MOLE, including endorsements. More on this in a bit: for now, let's look at how PoMFRIT works in more detail.

Awell-known paradigm for designing blind signaturesÂ is the following. First, the client places the message in the cryptographic equivalent of a sealed envelope, called acommitment. For our purposes, a commitment is simply the hash of the message together with some randomness generated by the client. To complete issuance, the signer simply signs the commitment directly.

To construct the blind signature, the client produces a zero-knowledge proof of knowledge of the signature and the randomness it used to compute the commitment, called the opening. A verifier would use the signer's public key to verify this proof.

Let's define a bit of notation to make this clearer:

1. The client generates an openingÂ rÂ and sends a commitment c=H(m,r)Â to its message mÂ to the issuer.
2. The issuer produces a signature s=Sign(sk,c)Â and sends it to the client. It doesnât learn the message as itâs hidden behind the hash.
3. Finally, the client produces a proofÏÂ of knowledge of s,rÂ for which Verify(pk,H(m,r))=1,

The proof ÏÂ is the blind signature. It can be verified by any party in possession of the issuer's public key pkÂ and the message m.

[翻译失败，原文如下]

Unlinkability comes from the client presenting entirely different objects during the two phases: a commitment is shown to the issuer during issuance, and a zero-knowledge proof is shown to a verifier during presentation. Even if the issuer and verifier collude or are the same entity, they cannot link the sessions.

The size of the proofÏÂ is dominated by evaluation of the hash, so we need to choose a hash function that is friendly for our proof system. For most proof systems, such proof-friendly hashes are not well studied, but for VOLEitH it turns out that the Keccak permutation used inSHAKEÂ andTurboSHAKEÂ is aÂ good choice. KeccakâsÂ bitwise operations translate natively into VOLEitH constraints: XOR becomes addition, AND becomes multiplication, and rotations simply rearrange values. (Many popular SNARKs, by contrast, are designed for large prime fields, making byte- and bit-oriented operations less natural to express.)

Nevertheless, Keccak evaluations end up being the largest component of the VOLEitH proof, so we need to make sure we're using only the minimum necessary number of permutations. PoMFRIT requires two: one for the commitment and another for the signature. Concretely, the statement we prove is roughly P(s)=H(H(m,r),rs) where s is the signature, rsis a salt chosen by the issuer, P is the issuer's UOV public key, and H denotes the Keccak permutation with the output truncated to the appropriate length, which also prevents anyone from inverting.

### From blind signatures to endorsements and beyond

Recall that for MOLE endorsements, we need something like a blind signature, but one that doesn't reveal the anchor that issued it. That is, we now have a sequence of anchor keys P1,â¦,PN, and the statement we now want to prove isÂ  Pi(s)=H(H(m,r),rs) for some anchor key Piwhose index i is now part of the hidden witness.

With some care, we can write this as a set of constraints with roughly the same cost: two hashes and one MQ evaluation. We need to prove a bit more about the witness. What exactly? We won't spoil it for you: ZK circuit design is part of the craft of cryptographic engineering that makes it so fun. We'll just say the kind of thinking needed here is transferable to just about any modern proof system you might encounter.

Even more advanced credential systems can be constructed in this framework, including the aforementioned anonymous credit tokens and anonymous rate-limited credentials. In both of these cases, the primary cost is an additional hash or two. Each of these also requires proving that part of the witness (e.g., the credit count) is in some expected range, but this is low cost in VOLEitH.

Indeed, for every construction we have considered so far for MOLE, the primary cost is the size of the Keccak evaluation and how many times we need to evaluate it. This means that finding ways to reduce the amount of hashing yields improvements across the board.

### Optimizations

Before we go any further, we need to acknowledge that cryptanalysis of multivariate cryptography is still relatively immature. We have seenadvances against several parameter regimesÂ in just the last couple of years, Both UOVÂ and MAYO have weathered these attacks well, and an outright break of UOV and even MAYO seems more unlikely with every passing year. But we should at least expect the parameters to change in a way that adds a bit of cost to our constructions.

On the other hand, it's not uncommon for credential systems used in practice to adopt a less-than-conservative security posture for the sake of performance in so far as it affects forgery resistance. This typically means relying on stronger-than-usual computational assumptions. That is, it's possible that a (pre-quantum) attack might come along that breaks anonymous credit tokens, but not ECDSA, despite the fact that they both use the same elliptic curve.

#### Using fewer hashes

PoMFRIT achieved its size record by doing precisely the same thing. Recall that the blind signature requires proving two hash evaluations, one by the client and the other by the issuer. PoMFRIT observes that VOLEitH proof generation can be split into two stages. In the first stage, the client commits to a random mask. It then hashes the message normally (outside of the ZK circuit), combines the result with the mask, and sends the masked target to the issuer. The issuer uses the UOV trapdoor to find a preimage of this target. In the second stage, the client completes the proof that the preimage and previously committed mask are consistent. The hash remains part of the protocol, but the issuer â acting as the VOLEitH verifier â can compute it directly rather than requiring the zero-knowledge proof to reproduce it.

This strategy substantially reduces proof size, but it also changes our security posture. The plain UOV assumption is that no (quantum) attacker can find a pre-image for a random target without knowledge of the trapdoor. The corresponding one-more-UOV assumption (analogous to the one-more-MAYO assumption in thePoMFRIT paper) neatly captures the additional information available to the attacker as a result of this kind of optimization. The assumption, then, is that this additional information doesn't lead to an attack.

This assumption may turn out to be overly optimistic. Recently, researchers at the University of California, San Diego, and INRIA managed toforge a 1024-bit RSA signatureÂ using a Privacy Pass issuer as a signing oracle. Fortunately, Privacy Pass uses 2048-bit RSA, which, in concert with other defense mechanisms, provides a pretty good security margin. Likewise, for UOV we might consider using NIST Level 3 parameters instead of Level 1.

In any case, a bit more study will be required before we rely too heavily on these kinds of optimizations. It's worth emphasizing that a break here would only impact an attacker's ability to forge tokens, not the attacker's ability to violate a client's privacy.

#### Making each hash cheaper

Standard SHAKE uses a 1600-bit Keccak state with 24 applications of an underlying round function. However, since the SHA-3 standard was published, many have come to believe that 24 rounds is justtoo much crypto. TurboSHAKEÂ works the same way, except the permutation uses 12 rounds instead of 24. This substantially reduces the size of VOLEitH proofs. In fact, we're quite comfortable with this security margin, and not just for this application.

Another change to Keccak that reduces the proof size is to reduce the size of the state.Â 256 bits of the state are reserved for thecapacityÂ to get 128 bits security. That leaves 1344 bits that can be hashed in one go, which is more than we need. Reducing the state by half to 800 bits leaves us with a rate of 544 bits, which is plenty. On top of that, it even increases the security at the same number of rounds, as an attacker has less to play with. The smaller state means weâre using half the multiplications in our circuit, which reduces the size of the proof.

#### Leaning into multivariate

In an ideal world, we could avoid proving conventional hashes altogether by replacing each hash with something that composes more natively with the algebraic structure of our primitives. Indeed, those familiar withPedersen commitmentsÂ and their use in elliptic curve cryptography may wonder if commitments can be constructed from multivariate cryptography.

This might look something likethis: Fix public, random MQ maps FÂ and GÂ and commit to a message mÂ using c=(m+F(r),G(r)). The advantage of this approach is that the degree of the constraints is the same as the degree of the constraints for the UOV signature. Not only does this make the proof smaller, it makes it far simpler, since we avoid evaluating symmetric crypto in ZK altogether.

[翻译失败，原文如下]

We experimented with this approach for our application, and it yielded some impressive results. However, it's not at all clear yet if the parameter regime in which multivariate commitments yield an improvement is also secure. Notably, the risk here is not just to unforgeability, but also to client privacy. A lot more study is needed.

Another direction is to build an MQ-friendly pseudorandom generator (PRG).

For typical VOLEitH parameters, adding an extra witness bit adds ten bits to the proof. There is a neat trick to make this a lot cheaper: only one bit of proof per bit of witness! Instead of using VOLEitH directly, we commit to a (relatively) short key. That key we stretch into a larger bitstream using aÂ PRG with low-degree so that it can be computed cheaply in the circuit.Â Now, to add a witness bit w, we get one extra bit kÂ from the PRG, and store the bit w XOR kÂ in the proof.

There is a performance trade-off: we need to compute the PRG and the witnesses start at degree 2 instead of 1. That especially increases prover time. Also the benefits on proof size only start to pay off when you need a decent number of witness bits.

And of course you need a PRG! You can create a PRG using a random MQ instance, but thatâs very slow and seems overly conservative. At the other end is theGoldreichÂ PRG,Â which can be seen as an as-sparse-as-possible MQ PRG. WeâdwantÂ something in between, but such PRGs havenât received much study.

## Is MOLE ready for post-quantum?

We already have post-quantum privacy today, so we have some time before we need to have a solution in place, but now is the time to develop alternatives.

Multivariate cryptography looks to be a promising basis for easily building a variety of anonymous tokens and credentials. We're currently developing two schemes in this framework: VOLE-IHAT, a candidate for MOLE endorsements, and VOLE-ACT, a candidate for MOLE credentials. Our current cost estimates for these are shown in the table below. The numbers here are subject to change as we analyze and develop these constructions. We use UOV (uov-Ip) in each case, which means the public keys are all 46.6KB. VOLEitH uses the same parameters as FAEST-EM-128s:

issuance

presentation

PoMFRIT (with UOV)

4.3KB (redemption)

VOLE-IHAT

5.6KB

6.5KB (redemption)

VOLE-ACT

5.4KB

12.0KB (spend)

These numbers are significantly larger than their classical counterparts. This comes as no great surprise, as "PQ is big" is really the main hallmark of the transition across the board. However, replacing RSA blind signatures with PoMFRIT has comparable overhead to replacing ECDSA with ML-DSA. The runtimes of these protocols are also excellent: each operation takes just a few milliseconds with ourimplementation. (Runtime can be improved by quite a bit, though at the cost of higher communication.)

If these numbers hold, then we've already reached an important milestone: the transition to PQ anonymous credentials for the web can now shift from cryptography design to protocol engineering. In other words, we think we can make these numbers work. For example, whereas classical blind signatures might be cheap enough to redeem on every request, we'll have to figure out how to amortize a single redemption over multiple requests.

We have some work to do before we get there. First, we need to make sure our protocols are sound, in particular by producing securityÂ proofs for them that show they are secure as long as UOV is secure. Second, we need to wait a bit for cryptanalysis of UOV to catch up. We encourage cryptographers to spend time with multivariate cryptography. Once the parameters stabilize, we believe these schemes will find a place in a ton of useful applications. We've only just scratched the surface so far.
